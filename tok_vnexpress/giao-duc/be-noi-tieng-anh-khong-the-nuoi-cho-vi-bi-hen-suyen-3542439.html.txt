You ’ re going to be 10 years old .
Ok .
That ’ s good .
Do you like to have a pet ?
Yes , of course .
I love dogs .
Oh you love dogs .
I mean puppies .
I know that they are noisy and messy and my dad said that we had to clean their poop .
Oh , their poop .
But they are cute .
And I love to watch them sleep .
They even can eat with us , play with us and even race with us .
Really ? You have a dog at home ?
Just because I have asthma so my dad said that I cannot have a dog .
It ’ s a pity to hear that .
Ok .
Thank you .
