You know I learned a fact about … ( 1 ) … the other day .
Now this was so surprised to see .
I was talking to a … ( 2 ) …   and he told me that many of his passengers think planes are dangerous to fly in .
But he said actually , it is a lot more … ( 3 ) … for a plane to stay on the ground .

What ignites that spark ?
You can ’ t “ kinda ” want that , you got to want it with every part of your whole … ( 12 ) …   .
Will you struggle ?

Yeah , you will struggle , no way around it .
You will fall many times , but who ’ s … ( 13 ) … ?
