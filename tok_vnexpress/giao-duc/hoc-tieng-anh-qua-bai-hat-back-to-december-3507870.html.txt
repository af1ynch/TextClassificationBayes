I ' m so glad you made time to see me
How ' s life ?
Tell me how ' s your family ?
I haven ' t seen them in a while
You ' ve been good , busier than ever ,
We small talk , work and the weather , Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride ,
Standing in front of you saying , " I ' m sorry for that night , "
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain ' t nothing but missing you
Wishing I ' d realized what I had when you were mine
I ' d go back to December , turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days I haven ' t been sleeping ,
Staying up , playing back myself leavin '
When your birthday passed and I didn ' t call
And I think about summer , all the beautiful times ,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came , the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was " Goodbye " .
