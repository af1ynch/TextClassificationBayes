You better not cry
You better not   pout
I ' m telling you why
( Santa_Claus is coming to town ) x 3
He ' s making a list ,
He ’ s checking it twice ;
Gonna find out who ' s   naughty or nice
( Santa_Claus is coming to town ) x 3
He sees you when you ' re sleeping
He knows when you ' re awake
He knows if you ' ve been bad or good
So be good   for goodness sake
With little   tin horns   and little   toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
( Santa_Claus is coming to town ) x 3
He sees you when you ' re sleeping
He knows when you ' re awake
He knows if you ' ve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I ' m telling you why
Santa_Claus is coming to town
Santa_Claus is coming to town
Santa_Claus is coming
Santa_Claus is coming
Santa_Claus is coming to town
