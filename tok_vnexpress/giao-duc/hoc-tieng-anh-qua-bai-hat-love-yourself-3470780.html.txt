For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart , oh , girl for goodness ' sake
You think I ' m crying on my own .
Well , I ain ' t
And I didn ' t wanna write a song
' Cause I didn ' t want anyone thinking I still care .
I don ' t ,
But you still hit my phone up
And , baby , I be movin ' on
And I think you should be somethin ' I don ' t wanna hold back ,
Maybe you should know that
My mama don ' t like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I ' ve been so caught up in my job ,
Didn ' t see what ' s going on
But now I know ,
I ' m better sleeping on my own ' Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh , baby , you should go and love yourself And if you think that I ' m still holdin ' on to somethin '
You should go and love yourself .
