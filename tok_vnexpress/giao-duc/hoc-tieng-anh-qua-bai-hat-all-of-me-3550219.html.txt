What would I do without your smart mouth ? Drawing me in , and you kicking me out
You ' ve got my head spinning , no kidding , I can ' t pin you down
What ' s going on in that beautiful mind
I ' m on your magical mystery ride
And I ' m so dizzy , don ' t know what hit me , but I ' ll be alright
My head ' s under water
But I ' m breathing fine
You ' re crazy and I ' m out of my mind
' Cause all of me
Loves all of you Love your curves and all your edges All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I ' ll give my all to you
You ' re my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I ' m winning
' Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you , oh oh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you ' re crying you ' re beautiful too
The world is beating you down , I ' m around through every mood
You ' re my downfall , you ' re my muse
My worst distraction , my rhythm and blues
I can ' t stop singing , it ' s ringing , in my head for you
