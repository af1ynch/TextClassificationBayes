Remember when I was young and so were you
and time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first , so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when
Remember when we vowed the vows
and walked the walk
Gave our hearts , made the start , it was hard
We lived and learned , life threw curves
There was joy , there was hurt
Remember when
Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed , disassembled , rearranged
We came together , fell apart
And broke each other ' s hearts
Remember when
Remember when the sound of little feet
was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love , we found trust
Vowed we ' d never give it up
Remember when
