Bản tiếng Anh :
A young man was soon going to graduate college .
For many months , he admired a very beautiful sports car .
He knew that his father   could afford it   so he told him that he wanted that car .
As graduation day   near , he waited for signs that his father had bought that car for him .
Finally it was graduation day .
On the morning of graduation , his father told him that how proud he was to have such a good son and how much he loved him .
After saying this , the father   handed a wrapped gift box to his son   as a graduation present .
Curiously , the son opened that gift .
He found a   Bible   with a beautiful leather cover .
The son angrily raised voice at his father , " With all the money you have , you bought me a Bible ? " and left instantly , leaving the book there .
Years passed by and he never returned home .
The young man became a very successful businessman   in the meantime .
He had a beautiful house and happy family .
Years later , he realized that he should go to his father ’ s house as he never returned after leaving the house on that day .
Before he could   make arrangements   to return home to his father , he received a telegram informing him about his father ’ s death .
It was to inform him that his father   willed all his possessions to his son   and he should come home as soon as he can to take care of things .
He returned home but upon   reaching   home , his heart was filled with regrets and sadness .
He began to search for important papers and saw that the Bible his father had gifted was still new .
With tears , he opened the bible and began to turn the pages and as he read those words , suddenly a car key dropped from an envelope which was stuck behind the bible .
It had a tag with the dealer ’ s name , same one who had the sports car he desired .
The date on tag was of his graduation day with words written on it , " PAID_IN_FULL " .
